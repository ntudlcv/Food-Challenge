# Usage
To start working on this final project, you should clone this repository into your local machine by using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/DLCV-Fall-2020/food-classification-<team_name>.git
Note that you should replace `<team_name>` with your own team name.

### Dataset
In the starter code of this repository, we have provided a shell script for downloading and extracting the dataset for this assignment. For Linux users, simply use the following command.

    bash ./get_dataset.sh
The shell script will automatically download the dataset and store the data in a folder called `food_data`. Note that this command by default only works on Linux. If you are using other operating systems, you should download the dataset from [this link](https://drive.google.com) and unzip the compressed file manually.

> ⚠️ ***IMPORTANT NOTE*** ⚠️  
> 1. Please do not disclose the dataset! Also, do not upload your get_dataset.sh to your (public) Github.
> 2. You should keep a copy of the dataset only in your local machine. **DO NOT** upload the dataset to this remote repository. If you extract the dataset manually, be sure to put them in a folder called `food_data` under the root directory of your local repository so that it will be included in the default `.gitignore` file.

> 🆕 ***NOTE***  
> For the sake of conformity, please use the `python3` command to call your `.py` files in all your shell scripts. Do not use `python` or other aliases, otherwise your commands may fail in our autograding scripts.
